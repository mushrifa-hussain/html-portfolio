<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello! I’m Mushrifa Hussain, a dedicated and creative aspiring web developer with a growing passion for turning ideas
  into interactive, functional websites. I’m currently pursuing a comprehensive Web Development course on Udemy, where
  I’m building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other essential web technologies.
</p>
<p>
  What started as a curiosity for how websites work has now turned into a deeper interest in coding, design, and solving
  real-world problems through technology. Every day, I’m learning something new — whether it’s creating responsive
  layouts, debugging code, or experimenting with modern tools and frameworks. I enjoy the process of building, breaking,
  and improving.
</p>
<p>
  I’m particularly drawn to front-end development, where creativity meets functionality. I love bringing designs to life
  and ensuring they work smoothly across all devices. At the same time, I'm also exploring the back-end side of things —
  understanding how data, logic, and user interactions work behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from coding, I believe in continuous learning, collaborating with others, and staying curious. I’m excited to
  grow as a developer and eventually contribute to real-world projects that make a difference.
</p>
<p>
  This portfolio is a small glimpse into my learning journey — and just the beginning of what I hope will be a long and
  fulfilling career in tech.
